### Code Snippets

#### Bluetooth Device Scanning
```dart
import 'package:flutter_blue/flutter_blue.dart';

FlutterBlue flutterBlue = FlutterBlue.instance;

// Start scanning
flutterBlue.startScan(timeout: Duration(seconds: 4));

// Listen to scan results
var subscription = flutterBlue.scanResults.listen((results) {
    for (ScanResult r in results) {
        print('${r.device.name} found! rssi: ${r.rssi}');
    }
});

// Stop scanning
flutterBlue.stopScan();
```

#### Wi-Fi Connectivity Check
```dart
import 'package:wifi/wifi.dart';

void checkWifiConnectivity() async {
    var wifiName = await Wifi.ssid;
    print('Connected to Wi-Fi: $wifiName');
}
```

## Testing and Evaluation
